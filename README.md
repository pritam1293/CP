I’ve compiled all my competitive programming solutions in this repository named CP, including those submitted during contests on Codeforces, CodeChef, AtCoder, InterviewBit, and the CSES Problem Set. While most of my LeetCode problems are solved directly on the platform, selected noteworthy solutions are also included here. This collection showcases my problem-solving journey across multiple platforms. Additionally, you’ll find a dedicated CP Algos folder containing implementations of popular algorithms and data structures that I frequently use, serving as both a quick reference and a valuable learning resource.
