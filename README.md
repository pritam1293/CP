Iâ€™ve compiled all my competitive programming solutions in this repository, including those submitted during contests on Codeforces, CodeChef, AtCoder, and InterviewBit. While most of my LeetCode problems are solved directly on the platform, selected noteworthy solutions are also included here. This collection showcases my problem-solving journey across multiple platforms. You'll also find a dedicated CP Algos folder containing implementations of famous algorithms that I frequently use, serving as a quick reference and learning resource.
